# Typescript based Zabbix Sender Client

This small little utility allows you to send data packages using the trapper protocol to Zabbix. This project is a Typescript port of an already exisiting [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-zabbix-sender). It was ment for me as an exercise to port some vanilla Javascript code over to Typescript.
